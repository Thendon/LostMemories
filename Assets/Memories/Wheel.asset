  header: Ferris wheel
  description: My siblings and I used to play "I see something you don't see" on
    the Ferris wheel back then. But since the ride often seemed too short and we
    wanted to play some more, we rode several rounds.\n Even though we liked to argue
    sometimes, it was something we always looked forward to.
